## Story
Your guidance counselor at Apathy Abbey was quite certain you would never accomplish anything in your life, and said as much as he tossed you out into the muddy street.  That day, you vowed to prove him wrong and return to destroy the abbey one day, no matter if it were the last thing you ever do.

You procastinated a great deal in the intervening 17 years, a hard life on the streets taught you many lessons the monks of the abbey likely would never know, but beyond vagrancy, thievery, and thuggery you really haven't lived up to your vow.  Then you caught the plague.

It didn't take you long to stumble feverishly into the apothecary's shop, where you were assured that nothing could be done, and quickly ushered out the back door before you could afflict paying customers.  As you lay in the muddy back alley behind the apothecary, a black robed figure stands over you, two red eyes glow down at you from underneath the hood.  Reaching out a bony hand it holds before you a glowing purple amethyst.

You have made a terrible bargain to cheat death, and now wear the stone against your pale plague scarred neck.  It is cold, its chill burns like a fire, and like a fire it must be stoked.  Only life force can fuel the stone, and you have far too little of that remaining to fullfill the vow you made so long ago.

#### How to play
Use arrow keys to move around the map, and click mouse on to interact with with enemies and items, and by interact we mean steal their life force.

You see, that's because you've been turned into a Liche! You wear a magical phylactery around your neck that keeps you alive, but only so long as it is fueled with life force.  If you lose too many battles, or fail to collect more life force for it to feed off it will consume what little remains of your own!

You have vowed to destroy Apathy Abbey, to teach the monks that reside within a lesson for kicking you out many years ago.  Make your way through the wilderness, find your way back to the abbey, your old guidance counselor awaits.
